            Chinese architecture is typified by timber structures, with a platform, a post-and-lintel frame, a system of
            roof-supporting brackets, and a heavy, sloping roof. Three factors have had a significant influence on
            Japanese visual arts: Chinese visual arts, indigenous themes and customs, and Buddhist iconography. The Hry
            Temple (7th century) pioneered a distinctive Japanese architectural style: asymmetrical layouts that follow
            the land's contours. The 16thâ€“18th centuries screen and panel paintings, as well as the polychrome woodcut,
            which evolved into the popular ukiyo-e print, demonstrate Japanese painters' preoccupation with abstraction
            from nature. Among the noteworthy characteristics of Korean art are the use of stone in architecture and
            sculpture, as well as the development of an exceptional celadon glaze.
