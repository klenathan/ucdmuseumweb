          <p>
            Formulated in part on the basis of contemporary scientific judgments and in part on the basis of
            enthusiastic generalists' synthesis, these views on the qualities of Japanese culture and, more
            specifically, Japanese art, unsurprisingly reflected the prejudices and tastes of the period. The artistic
            inclination for refinement, for images that were discreetly imbued with metaphoric meaning, reflected the
            sublimely refined court customs that permitted only oblique references to emotion and favored suggestion
            over outright statement. Concurrent with the canonization of the Heian court style was the belief that the
            tea ceremony's aesthetic sensibilities were authentically Japanese. This 16th-century community ritual
            emphasizes the hyperconscious juxtaposition of found and carefully created things in order to induce subtle
            epiphanies of understanding. Additionally, it emphasized the centrality of indirection and understatement in
            the Japanese aesthetic.
