          <p>
            Through the years, the fundamental trend in Korean art has been naturalistic, a trend that began during the
            Three Kingdoms period (c. 57 BCE–668 CE) but was firmly established during the Unified, or Great, Silla
            (Korean: Shinla) period (668–935). Accepting nature as it is has resulted in a well developed respect for
            the plain and unadorned. Korean painters, for example, favored the natural beauty of raw materials, such as
            wood grain patterns. Korean potters were notoriously indifferent with the mechanical correctness of their
            surfaces, curves, and shapes. His objective was to emphasize the intrinsic or natural qualities of his
            materials and medium. Thus, potters were allowed to work uninhibitedly and naturally, making ceramics that
            captivated with their simplicity and creative originality.
