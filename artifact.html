          <p>
            East Asian arts are comprised of the visual, performing, and musical arts of China, Korea (North and South
            Korea), and Japan. (This region's literature is discussed in separate pages on Chinese, Korean, and Japanese
            literature.) Certain studies of East Asia incorporate the civilizations of the Indochina peninsula and
            adjacent islands, as well as Mongolia to the north. This sporadic inclusion is justified by a tight
            geographic definition as well as a recognition of shared links formed by many of these cultures' embrace of
            Buddhism. China, Korea, and Japan, on the other hand, have been inextricably linked for several millennia
            through a shared written language and extensive cultural and political ties that ranged in spirit from
            fawning devotion to contention.
